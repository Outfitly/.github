### Project Overview
---
**Project Title**: Outfitly - Outfit Daily & Style Utility

Outfitly aims to solve the common challenge of selecting stylish, event-appropriate outfits. Many people struggle with outfit decisions due to time constraints or uncertainty in their fashion choices. While existing fashion platforms provide inspiration, few offer recommendations tailored to users’ actual wardrobes. 

Outfitly is designed to fill this gap by leveraging image recognition technology to assist users in selecting outfits based on the clothing items they already own. Users can upload images of their wardrobe items to receive customized outfit recommendations that consider their preferences, the occasion, and current fashion trends sourced from the internet.

### Key Research Questions
---
1. **Image Recognition Accuracy**: How accurately does the image recognition model identify and categorize clothing items?
2. **User Satisfaction and Efficiency**: How do personalized outfit recommendations affect user satisfaction and time efficiency in outfit selection?
3. **Behavioral Impact**: How do AI-generated outfit suggestions influence user behavior compared to traditional manual methods?

### Project Objectives
---
By providing context-aware, AI-driven styling options, Outfitly aims to:
- Streamline the outfit selection process.
- Empower users to enhance their personal style.
- Maximize the usability of existing wardrobe items.

### Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Outfit suggestions are tailored to user preferences, occasion type, and fashion trends.
- **Enhanced Styling Utility**: A focus on helping users make the most of their existing wardrobe for visually appealing, suitable combinations.
